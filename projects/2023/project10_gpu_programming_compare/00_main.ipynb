    "This project consists of several Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook processes a part of the overall tasks and saves its results in temporary text files so that the next step can process the intermediate results. There is no need to run any other build commands or shell scripts. All necessary commands are run from within the three notebooks listed below. The notebooks must be run to get the final benchmark results. The notebooks are:\n",

    "The current notebook is the main notebook and does not do any processing itself. But it can be used to run everything at once, as an alternative to running each of the above notebooks separately. It is intended that running this notebook alone will complete all the steps at once. The overall structure includes the following steps:\n",

    "- Compile the Fortran and C++ code\n",
    "- Run a reference configuration for each of the implementations and store the results for later verification\n",
    "- Run the actual benchmark, which scans over a set of configurations and again stores the results for later use\n",
    "- Compare the reference fields and verify that all implementations produce correct results\n",
    "- Combine the benchmark data and generate the desired plots\n",
